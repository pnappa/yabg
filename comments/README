perhaps that UUID will be a hash of the title? isn't too crazy of an idea... currently its an INTEGER type though



You need a .env file in here, it should contain something like the following:

    # TODO: better key
    HMAC_SECRET_KEY="iwannabetheguy"
    EXPECTED_HOSTNAME="localhost"
    
    # these should be set via an automatic benchmarking routine. basically, these depend on the machine you'll deploy to.
    # TODO: make this take longer, without DoS my server.
    # this leads to around 200 ms execution on my computer
    ARGON_ROUNDS=20
    # size in kiB to use (16MiB)
    ARGON_MEMORY=16384
    # number of threads to use (one because babby server)
    ARGON_THREADS=1
    # time in ms that we expect it to take on DO server (run argon2timing.py in the homedir), the above stats gave this figure.
    # we do this so we can sleep for that amount of time on wrong attempts.
    ARGON_EXPECTED_TIME=340
    # we sleep between 0 and this in ms to provide some noise.
    ARGON_FUZZING_TIME=50
